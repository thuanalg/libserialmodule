# Async C/C++ I/O with COM/Serial Port Library

## Principle: Unix Philosophy
KISS: Keep it simple, stupid!

## Overview 
This library provides a multi-threaded, cross-platform solution for managing multiple COM/Serial ports. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS while maintaining compatibility with all C/C++ versions from ANSI C89 to C++20. No external libraries are required; it solely relies on Win32/POSIX API and termios.

## Features
- **Multi-threaded (Thread-safe)**: Designed for concurrent access to multiple serial ports.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Minimal dependencies**: No external libraries required.
- **ANSI C89 to C++20 compatible**: Ensuring broad compiler support.
- **Efficient and high-performance**: Optimized for real-time communication.
